# Moon Phase Time Series Analysis ðŸŒ™

This project analyzes the **durations between lunar phases** (New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, Last Quarter) using **time series methods** such as ARIMA modeling, Fourier analysis, and residual diagnostics.  

We investigate whether lunar phase durations are evenly distributed and explore their cyclical fluctuations over time.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Moon phase data (1970â€“2021) from [Astropixels](https://astropixels.com/ephemeris/phasescat/phasescat.html)  
- **Goal**: Evaluate if the durations between phases are stable or exhibit meaningful variation.  
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (cycle durations & beating patterns)  
  - One-way ANOVA (testing equality of durations)  
  - Stationarity check with ADF test  
  - ARIMA modeling (short-term forecasting)  
  - Fourier Transform (long-term periodic structure detection)  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Lunar phase durations average ~7.38 days but are **not equal**.  
- They follow a **wave-like oscillation**, compensating each other to keep the total cycle consistent (~29.5 days).  
- ARIMA(13,0,5) model fits short-term trends but residuals show autocorrelation.  
- Fourier analysis reveals a strong **14-cycle periodicity**, matching astronomical expectations.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Extend dataset and integrate **astronomical simulations**.  
- Explore **nonlinear models** (TAR, GARCH) for residual dynamics.  
- Include Fourier terms directly into SARIMA models.
